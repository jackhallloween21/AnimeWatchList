A list showing all the animes and mangas/manga that I have watched or am currently watching.
I wrote all those 600+ anime/manga names and image links manually! ðŸ¥² 
I built this as I was not getting the feeling just by writing it in Onenote as it is not accessible without a Microsoft account and Onenote app. 
This Website is going to suck your internet like 250MBs to load so be careful if using a metered connection.
I have just used HTML, CSS, and JS.
Features
âš« Dark Mode and Light Mode Toggle
âš«Added Image source link from IMDb and Crunchyroll to get better-quality images.
âš«Added hover animation to Images to magnify and text to glow.
âš«Later I will think about a way to make this list easier to edit by some automation.
